PLEASE USE CSV FILE ATTACHED because there are 2-3 csv file sent by instructor and i used the file with "," separation whole program is designed accordingly. 

In my program i first created new process using fork than i checked that if fork executed correctly or not the using waitpid i executed child first

In child process i called getAverage function declared in my program which take Section as argument and print out the details of all student in that section with their AVERAGE on nextline;

In parent i called same function getAverage but with Section B as argument.

In my program i used only system call to print(write) ,to read csv file and open for file descriptor.There no use of printf.

Also as write only writes string i used sprintf function to convert  integer to string;
